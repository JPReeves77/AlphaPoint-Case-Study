## Business Activities:

The specific financial problems the company is solving deal not only with the tokenization of assets, but also providing a cradle to grave ecosystem of minting and trading platforms in which the assets are actively funded and traded. Brokerage services also are an integral part of the company’s financial ecosystem. This allows for 150+ customers in 35+ countries the ability to launch and operate crypto assets, as well as digitize normally illiquid assets (AlphaPoint, n.d.). Again, the cradle to grave aspect of AlphaPoint’s products, the ability to fund, structure, digitize assets, trade on primary and secondary markets, and custodian services gives AlphaPoint a market edge that many other firms do not offer.

The intended customers for AlphaPoint are:

  * Exchange Operators
  * Asset Managers / Funds
  * Brokers and Broker Dealers
  * Token Issuers
  * Custodians

According to G2 Stack and BuiltWith (Crunchbase, n.d.), among the 33 current technology products and services being used by AlphaPoint, some highlights are HTML5, Google Analytics, jQuery, Viewport Meta, Iphone / Mobile Compatible, SPF, NGINX, CloudFlare, Bootstrap, Google Tag Manager, Wordpress and G Suite (Stackshare.io, n.d.) .

## Landscape:

The current landscape in which AlphaPoint resides is the General Exchange Platforms. According to StackShare.io, AlphaPoint’s exchange platforms are able to process up to 1M transactions per second. This innovation has placed AlphaPoint as one of the industry leaders among its competitors. Competitors include but are not limited to (Growjo.com, n.d.) :

 * Noble Markets
 * Crux Informatics
 * ConsenSys
 * LiquidX
 * Ujo
 * Blockstack
 * EquityZen

Other innovations besides the 1M transactions per second capability on AlphaPoint exchanges include streamlined digitization of assets with of course the complete ability to carry a customer from start, funding, and regulatory management to finished product all within one system without the need to bring in 3rd party providers, aside from KYC and AML advisors, which the company does not specialize in (Scott Bambacigno, VP Global Sales, personal communication, 12 November 2020).

## Results:

Aside from, again, a cradle to grave ecosystem for asset development, trade, and management, the company has been able to provide white-label software that powers crypto-exchanges worldwide (35+ countries). Being scalable, secure, and customizable, AlphaPoint’s exchanges and platforms have helped many startups and institutions develop their brand of blockchains.

Since AlphaPoint specializes in asset digitization and the platforms in which to trade said assets, traditional metrics don’t always capture the whole picture. Take for example the Supply Equity Ratio (SER). The SER accounts for distribution of assets among different accounts within a network, and is not used in traditional markets. A high SER signifies high distribution of supply and a low SER indicates the supply is in the hands of the few. The SER, therefore, measures the distribution of wealth amongst wallet holders. However, the SER only captures distribution of a single asset, a caveat is that a single individual can hold many wallets across many assets (Nuzzi, 2020).

Thus, another metric for supply distribution is the Network Distribution Factor or NDF. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate supply in wallet addresses holding more than 0.01% of the asset’s supply and dividing by total supply. In total, the SER and NDF capture the equitability of an asset amongst the supply in existence, and measure what levels of investors have the capability to keep the market fluid (Nuzzi, 2020).

Compared to the competition, AlphaPoint is still small, clearing an annual revenue of $5.2M per year. When compared to larger competitors like Crux Informatics ($7.4M) it is on par, but bigger competitors like Consensys clear $64.5M in revenue. AlphaPoint’s estimated revenue per employee is $130K, which is on par with even the bigger competitors in the arena like Consensys which has a similar revenue per employee (Growjo.com, n.d.).

## Recommendations:

I only have one suggestion for the company based on my limited knowledge of the arena, and that comes from AlphaPoint’s intent to be a one-stop shop for asset digitization and markets. That stems from the correspondence I had with the VP of Global Sales Scott Bambacigno, where he stated that AlphaPoint does not have an internal KYC or AML advisor department. He stated that clients must acquire outside vendors for such advisory. I think that if AlphaPoint wants to capture the idea that they are indeed a one-stop-shop, they should have complete guidance from cradle to grave. 

In essence, anecdotally, AlphaPoint captures 95% of the process in my opinion, and that 5% that is missing is a big factor for many clients who typically are not experts on the whole process. If AlphaPoint truly wants to advertise that cradle to grave hand-holding service for clients to get their asset digitized, liquid, scaled and trading, they need to beef up the legal compliance and advisory services. I feel that when the digitization ball gets passed back to the client for that brief moment in the regulatory process, too many openings for missed opportunities and communication breakdown may occur. It just opens another chain for failure in the model.

Nevertheless, AlphaPoint is an exceptional example of a leader in the ever maturing environment that is asset digitization. Aside from the KYC and AML deficiencies, there is nothing keeping AlphaPoint from ultimately providing those services and regulatory guidance. AlphaPoint is a small company vis a vis the competition, but their metrics show them on par with the larger competition. AlphaPoint is one of the older companies in the industry, thus proving its staying power and acceptance among the crypto community at large.
